# LocalPlanner

LocalPlanner (work in progress) is a social media site that will function like yelp and TripAdvisor. 
However, this will rely on locals creating and suggesting places or things to do in their home town. 

This is a side project for me, and if you happen to see this and would like to contribute ideas or help out,
email me at leebrian97@yahoo.com with the subject [LOCALPLANNER - IDEA] or [LOCALPLANER - ASSIST] depending on which
you would like to do.

Thanks!
